### Welcome to my crypto starter framework. This is a monorepo for developing anything and everything for crypto.  
## While this is currently under development, the goals are as follows:
- Starter Contracts for each token standard
- Extensions to add functionality for starter contracts
- Using strongly typed languages and extensive testing
- Support for as many blockchains as possible

I will update my goals as I continue development

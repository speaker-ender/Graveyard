# DeadCoin Dapp

## About
This is a starter Gatsby.JS site to interact with the Deadcoin Contract.  
The goal is to create a simple site that best represents the fastest and most performant implementation of Web3 interactions on top of the Gatsby.JS platform.  

## Current State
This is currently under heavy development.
Currently testing the benefits of writing all web3 code using ethersJS vs using a framework like Web3-React.
